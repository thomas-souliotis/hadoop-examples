#Hadoop examples
Various hadoop example codes. 
A shell script is included to all of the separate tasks for easier execution. Just change the 'inputFile' and 'outputFile' in the bash script, and they are ready to run. 
Each of them will have a README file (future work) which will describe how it functions.
